      <description>What is Your Mission Statement? When you are working online, especially when trying to multitask, it is extremely easy to get lost in a sea of 30-40 tabs that leads you floundering. Indeed, cluttered tabs not only reduce your productivity but can also leave you more stressed and frustrated, as you struggle to keep track of everything. FocusTabs was built to address this issue, assisting the user with keeping track of all of the tabs needed to achieve each of their goals, and hence improving their overall virtual experience.</description>
