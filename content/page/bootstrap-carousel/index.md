# Who Built the Extension?

FocusTabs was built as part of the curriculum for University of Pennsylvania's CIS3500 class ("Software Design & Engineering"), instructed by Professor [Jérémie O. Lumbroso](https://github.com/jlumbroso), during the 2024 spring semester.

### Team

FocusTabs was built by Anirudh Bharadwaj (BSE, Computer Science), Eshan Singhal (BASc, Physics & BE, Computer Engineering), Guilherme Feitosa (BA, Economics), and Kofi Addae-Sakyi – all undergraduate students at the University of Pennsylvania.

### Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Professor Jérémie O. Lumbroso for his fundamental mentorship all throughout the development of FocusTabs. Likewise, all four of us would like to extend our gratitude to [Filipe Carneiro](https://github.com/filipecarneiro), who spearheaded the landing page we used as a template for ours. The GitHub for the template can be found [here](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme).
