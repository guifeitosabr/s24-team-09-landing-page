<p>When you are working online, especially when trying to multitask, it is extremely easy to get lost in a sea of 30-40 tabs that leads you floundering. Indeed, cluttered tabs not only reduce your productivity but can also leave you more stressed and frustrated, as you struggle to keep track of everything. FocusTabs was built to address this issue, assisting the user with keeping track of all of the tabs needed to achieve each of their goals, and hence improving their overall virtual experience.</p>
<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>
<p>FocusTab&rsquo;s target audience is primarily high school and college students, who often have to manage multiple assignments for various classes. Nevertheless, this Chrome extension is aimed at whoever has to juggle different demands online, such as professionals with heavy workloads, individuals applying for new job opportunities, and more.</p>
<h3 id="selling-points">Selling Points</h3>
<ol>
<li>FocusTabs increases your productivity by only opening tabs tailored to what you want to do.</li>
<li>FocusTabs enables you to seamlessly navigate between different tasks without you needing to open and close multiple tabs.</li>
<li>FocusTabs ensures that your tabs are efficiently organized so that you always know where your work for a particular project can be found.</li>
<li>FocusTabs suggests tab grouping and names to further optimize your workflow.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="references--inspiration">References &amp; Inspiration</h2>
<p>Our motivation to build FocusTabs came directly from our own experience in high school and in college, often becoming flustered with the amount of tabs open for various, unrelated projects, from lecture notes and homework to job applications and leisure, amongst others (many others).</p>
