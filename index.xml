      <description>{ .img-fluid .mb-5}&#xA;This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see Issue 62196 and Issue 62197. This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:&#xA;A new general-purpose Process method and filter. A new Opacity filter.&#xA;Release Notes on GitHub.</description>

      <description>{ .img-fluid }&#xA;It’s official, the final stable release of v5.3.0 has landed! It’s been a monumental effort to revamp our codebase for CSS variables and color modes, one that will see continued changes leading up to an eventual Bootstrap 6. And we’re so excited to finally ship it!&#xA;On top of all the work that’s gone into this release, a lot has happened behind the scenes since we shipped our pre-releases.</description>

      <description>{ .img-fluid .mb-5 }&#xA;This release is mostly motivated by the fix for the panic experienced by people having blackfriday configured as defaultMarkdownHandler (#9968). The Blackfriday support was removed in Hugo v0.100.0 after being deprecated with a warning for a long time.&#xA;v0.100.1 fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file.&#xA;$page.RenderString (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.</description>

      <description>What is Your Mission Statement? When you are working online, especially when trying to multitask, it is extremely easy to get lost in a sea of 30-40 tabs that leads you floundering. Indeed, cluttered tabs not only reduce your productivity but can also leave you more stressed and frustrated, as you struggle to keep track of everything. FocusTabs was built to address this issue, assisting the user with keeping track of all of the tabs needed to achieve each of their goals, and hence improving their overall virtual experience.</description>
